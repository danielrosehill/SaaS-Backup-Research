Please generate a taxonomy in CSV format.

The purpose of this taxonomy is to list 30 categories of SaaS tools that are used predominantly by large companies and enterprises.

Please consider both tools used by businesses of various sizes as well as tools that are unlikely to be used by any business type other than very large organisations with sizeable headcounts and revenue.

It should have these headers:

Category,Description,Examples

"Category" is the name of the catgory
"Desription" is a one sentence description of the category
"Examples" provides 3 examples
