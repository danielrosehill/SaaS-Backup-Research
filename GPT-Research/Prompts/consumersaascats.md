Please generate a taxonomy in CSV format.

The purpose of this taxonomy is to list 50 categories of SaaS tools that are used by private individuals. 

By "private individuals" I mean tools that people use and purchase for their own use rather than on behalf of a business - whether their own or one they work for. 

Create an alphabetical category list and output it as a CSV. 
It should have these headers:

Category,Description,Examples

"Category" is the name of the catgory
"Desription" is a one sentence description of the category
"Examples" provides 3 examples

Here is an example to guide your creation. I'm using slashes to separate values

Note-taking apps /
Apps for creating, storing and editing text notes / 
Evernote, Notion, OneNote

Please generate this output as raw CSV
