 # SaaS Backup Approaches: Thoughts, Observations, Data

 ### Introduction

Welcome to this repository, which is intended to serve as an updated version of my previous "Cloud Backup Approaches" repository (found [here](https://github.com/danielrosehill/CloudBackupApproaches)). The original repository was a starting point for documenting the backup approaches offered by various SaaS providers, but as time has gone on, I found it necessary to start fresh. Enough restructuring was needed that it made more sense to create a new repository rather than simply updating the old one.

Backup and data protection are subjects that I've been interested in for many years. While I fully embrace and support cloud computing, I have long been frustrated by the entrenched expectation among SaaS providers that offering consumers the means to back up and export their own data is a "nice to have" rather than a fundamental responsibility. 

The initial repository aimed to provide a minimal index of the backup mechanisms available across different SaaS providers—serving both as a source of documentation and as a means to highlight the variability in the level of data protection offered. This updated version retains the same core purpose but with additional goals in mind:

- **Evaluation Criteria**: I plan to propose a comprehensive set of evaluation criteria to compare the degree to which different SaaS providers allow consumers to back up their data. This will make it easier for end-users to understand the backup options available to them and to make informed decisions.

- **Best Practices Suggestions**: I intend to suggest what I believe should be a bare minimum set of backup functionalities that every SaaS provider should offer. These include offering customers free and unrestricted API access to extract all their data, incrementally, and at will. Such capabilities are fundamental in ensuring that consumers have control over their own information.

- **Ranking System**: Ultimately, I'd like to establish a formalized ranking system based on the criteria suggested, so we can easily see which SaaS providers are leading in data backup and protection—and which are lagging behind.

The goal here is not just to document but also to advocate for change. It's my hope that by creating a systematic evaluation and proposing a minimum set of standards, I can help push the conversation forward towards a future where data backup is recognized as an essential right of the consumer, rather than an optional add-on.

For those interested in more background, you can also read or listen to an interview I gave on the subject previously: ["Why Is It So Hard to Backup Consumer SaaS Products?"](https://www.backupwrapup.com/why-is-it-so-hard-to-backup-consumer-saas-products/).
